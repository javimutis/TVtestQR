# üì∫ TVtestQR ‚Äì Android TV Login with QR Code

**TVtestQR** is an Android TV prototype application designed to allow users to log in securely and easily by scanning a QR code displayed on their TV screen with a mobile device.  

> **Disclaimer:** This project was developed as a **proof of concept while working at Megamedia** and does not represent or expose the production code of the official application.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **QR Code Login:** Quickly sign in by scanning a unique QR code with your phone camera.  
- **Auto-Refreshing QR Code:** The code refreshes every 15 seconds to ensure security and uniqueness.  
- **Manual Login (Planned):** A fallback method allowing users to log in with email and password.  
- **Optimized Android TV UI:** Built using **Leanback** components for a clean and intuitive TV interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### QR Code Generation and Refresh  
- Implemented in `MainActivity.kt`.  
- A QR code and alphanumeric session code are generated and displayed on screen.  
- A `Handler` refreshes both every 15 seconds to keep the session secure.  

### Manual Login (Upcoming Feature)  
- Selecting *"Prefer another way to sign in"* will navigate to a traditional login screen.  
- Currently marked as **pending implementation** in this prototype.
